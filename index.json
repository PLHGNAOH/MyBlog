	"content": "Verifying Large-Scale Amazon S3 Data Integrity with Compute Checksum Operation As data volumes continue to grow, ensuring data integrity has become a critical requirement for organizations across all industries. Traditionally, verifying data integrity required downloading or restoring objects — a process that introduces high cost, operational overhead, and significant latency. With the introduction of Amazon S3 Compute Checksum using S3 Batch Operations, organizations can now verify data integrity directly at the storage layer, without retrieving the objects.\nThis capability makes large-scale checksum validation more efficient, cost-effective, and operationally reliable.\nWhy Checksums Matter Checksums detect even the smallest change in data — down to a single bit. They serve as the foundation for:\nDetecting corruption during storage or transfer Maintaining the reliability of data pipelines Supporting compliance, audit trails, and fixity workflows Tracking data integrity across its lifecycle S3 supports multiple checksum algorithms including SHA-1, SHA-256, MD5, CRC32, CRC32C, and CRC64NVME, the latter optimized for extremely large datasets due to its high speed and parallelization capabilities.\nPrerequisites Before running Compute Checksum operations, you need:\nPermissions to create and execute S3 Batch Operations jobs An IAM role that S3 Batch Operations can assume Three buckets: data bucket, manifest bucket, and report bucket Amazon Athena access for analyzing report data Separating these buckets improves governance and simplifies access control.\nCompute Checksum Workflow 1. Create and Upload the Manifest The manifest is a CSV file listing the objects (bucket, key, version) for which you want to compute checksums.\nAfter creating it, upload it to the manifest bucket so Batch Operations can read it.\n2. Configure IAM Permissions Required permissions include: Reading source objects Reading the manifest Writing the completion report If objects are encrypted with SSE-KMS, decryption permissions must also be included.\nThe IAM role should be created using the S3 Batch Operations use case for proper compatibility.\n3. Create and Run the Compute Checksum Job To run the job:\nSelect your manifest file Choose Compute Checksum as the operation Choose: Calculation type: Full object Recommended algorithm: CRC64NVME Assign the correct IAM role Run the job and monitor its progress Batch Operations scales seamlessly, allowing checksum validation for millions or billions of S3 objects.\n4. Retrieve the Completion Report Once the job finishes:\nOpen the job details Access the completion report stored in the report bucket Copy the S3 URI to use in Athena Each line of the report includes bucket, key, version, status, and a JSON field containing checksum results.\n5. Analyze the Report with Athena Athena allows you to:\nCreate an external table pointing to the report folder Query for failed tasks or checksum mismatches Filter objects by error codes Flatten JSON fields into a structured CSV for downstream analysis or auditing This enables fast, serverless analysis of checksum results at scale.\nWhen to Use Compute Checksum? Compute Checksum is ideal for:\nLong-term archival data validation Regulatory compliance (HIPAA, FedRAMP, financial audits) Large-scale analytics, ML/AI datasets Massive media assets Backup validation and fixity workflows Any workload that relies on data correctness benefits from automated checksum validation.\nConclusion Amazon S3 Compute Checksum Operation provides an efficient, scalable, and cost-effective solution for verifying data integrity across massive datasets.\nBy eliminating the need to retrieve objects, organizations reduce operational complexity while improving the speed and reliability of data validation workflows.\nCombined with S3 Batch Operations and Athena, Compute Checksum becomes a powerful tool for modern data governance, compliance, and large-scale integrity verification.\n"

	"content": "How Strangeworks Uses Amazon Braket to Explore Aircraft Cargo Loading Optimization Quantum computing holds the promise of accelerating solutions for complex industrial optimization problems. In this blog, the Strangeworks team (an AWS partner) evaluates different implementations of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for an aircraft cargo loading problem posed by Airbus as part of their Quantum Mobility Challenge.\nThe study compares multiple QAOA variants and benchmarks them on the Rigetti Ankaa-3 QPU available through Amazon Braket.\nBackground: The Aircraft Cargo Loading Problem The Airbus cargo loading task represents a bin-packing optimization problem, common in travel, manufacturing, and logistics.\nThese problems are notoriously hard because the number of possible configurations grows exponentially with the number of containers and spaces.\nQuantum computing may accelerate such optimization tasks, especially through hybrid quantum-classical algorithms like QAOA—well-suited to today’s NISQ hardware.\nAlthough current quantum hardware does not outperform classical state-of-the-art solvers, the study successfully achieved correct solutions on problems up to 80 variables/qubits, demonstrating meaningful progress.\nQAOA Variants Evaluated Strangeworks evaluated three QAOA variants:\nStandard QAOA – provided in multiple open-source libraries, including Amazon Braket’s algorithm library. Relax-and-Round (QRR) QAOA – a variant from Rigetti improving classical cost computation. StrangeworksQAOA – Strangeworks’ enhanced version featuring improved classical optimization steps. The Strangeworks variant consistently outperformed standard QAOA and improved QRR when applied.\nUsing Braket Hybrid Jobs Through Strangeworks Hybrid algorithms like QAOA require orchestrating quantum and classical compute.\nStrangeworks used Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs, allowing the entire QAOA workflow to be submitted as a single job. Benefits include:\nReduced queueing overhead Cached circuit compilation, enabling reuse of previously compiled circuits Direct integration through Strangeworks Compute platform Together with the Rigetti Ankaa-3 hardware, this workflow provides a practical route for hybrid optimization at larger scales.\nBenchmarking Approach The benchmark focuses on the Airbus cargo loading problem, modeled as a QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization).\nDifferent container counts (n) and space counts (N) produce problem sizes up to 78 variables (which map directly to required qubits).\nStrangeworksQAOA was applied to the encoded QUBO.\nFigure 1 (PDF page 4) compares:\nStandard QAOA StrangeworksQAOA Rigetti’s QRR QAOA Strangeworks’ improved QRR QAOA The enhanced Strangeworks versions consistently delivered lower cost values and better approximation quality.\nLinear regression was applied to analyze scaling behavior.\nResults show:\nStrangeworksQRR has the gradient closest to the optimal Gurobi classical solver Standard QAOA scales poorly and diverges rapidly StrangeworksQAOA performs well on current sizes but may diverge at larger scales Algorithmic Insights: Why StrangeworksQAOA Performs Better QAOA iterates between:\nPreparing a parameterized quantum circuit Measuring bitstrings Computing classical cost Updating parameters Unlike traditional QAOA (which uses the most probable bitstring), StrangewworksQAOA:\nComputes cost for every measured bitstring Tracks the minimum-cost bitstring across all iterations Returns the best classical solution found Avoids issues where probability distributions flatten in large systems This approach is especially effective because the cargo loading problem requires a single optimal classical solution, not an averaged quantum state.\nResults \u0026amp; Interpretation Benchmarking showed that:\nStrangeworksQAOA significantly outperforms standard QAOA under identical noise conditions StrangeworksQRR achieves the closest match to Gurobi’s optimal solutions The improvements come entirely from better classical post-processing, with no additional quantum cost The method is robust to noise and scalable to larger systems compared to standard approaches These findings highlight the importance of optimizing classical components in hybrid algorithms.\nConclusion \u0026amp; Outlook This study demonstrates that carefully designed hybrid quantum-classical workflows—particularly improvements in the classical evaluation loop—can dramatically improve optimization results on current noisy quantum devices.\nAs quantum hardware continues to mature, such optimizations will be key to achieving practical quantum advantage.\nFor further exploration of these algorithms, users can access them via the Strangeworks platform and Amazon Braket.\n"

	"content": "Validate \u0026amp; Protect Amazon Route 53 DNS Zones and Records Amazon Route 53 plays a foundational role in modern cloud architectures by serving as a scalable and highly available DNS service. Because DNS is the first step in routing traffic across the Internet, any misconfiguration—intentional or accidental—can lead to severe disruptions, financial losses, and major operational issues.\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of how organizations can safeguard their DNS infrastructure through automation, monitoring, real-time alerting, and multi-layered access control.\n🎯 Objectives This post explains how to:\nAutomate recurring backups of DNS zones and records to Amazon S3. Detect and alert on risky changes in real time. Enforce strict least-privilege IAM permissions. Strengthen organization-wide governance with SCPs. Combined, these practices increase DNS reliability and reduce the chance of human error.\n⚙️ Prerequisites To implement the full solution, you need:\nAWS permissions: Route 53, IAM, Lambda, EventBridge, S3, CloudWatch. Existing hosted zones. Working knowledge of IAM policies and scheduled event-driven architecture. 1. Automating DNS Backups Backing up DNS data is crucial for preventing long outages resulting from misconfigurations. Many incidents occur because organizations lack a versioned history of DNS records.\nThe automated backup workflow leverages:\nEventBridge for scheduled triggers AWS Lambda for retrieving DNS data Amazon S3 for centralized, versioned storage 🔄 How the Backup Process Works A scheduled EventBridge rule triggers the backup job. Lambda retrieves all hosted zones and their associated DNS records. Backups are stored in S3 in structured folders by timestamp. Execution details are logged in CloudWatch for auditing and debugging. ✔️ Benefits of automated DNS backups Enables rapid recovery after accidental deletions Provides historical snapshots for auditing Simplifies troubleshooting and incident response Ensures consistent data retention without manual effort 2. Proactive DNS Protection Strategies Backup alone is not enough. DNS must be protected from risky operations before they happen.\n🔔 2.1 Real-Time Deletion Alerts Hosted zone deletion is one of the most disruptive actions in Route 53.\nTo detect such events immediately:\nCloudTrail logs the delete operation EventBridge matches the event SNS sends instant notifications to administrators This rapid alerting enables teams to respond swiftly and prevent widespread impact.\n🔐 2.2 IAM Least Privilege Enforcement Least privilege is essential to minimize dangerous mistakes.\nIAM policies should:\nLimit actions to only what a user or system requires Explicitly deny high-risk operations such as DeleteHostedZone Apply consistently across environments This practice significantly reduces human error and internal misuse.\n🛡️ 2.3 Strengthening Governance with SCPs While IAM restricts individual users, Service Control Policies enforce global restrictions across all AWS accounts in an organization.\nKey characteristics of SCPs:\nThey cannot be overridden by IAM. They apply to all member accounts under an AWS Organization or OU. They enforce uniform governance policies across teams. An SCP denying hosted zone deletion ensures critical DNS infrastructure remains protected under all circumstances.\n3. Cleaning Up Resources If running a test deployment, remove:\nLambda functions and CloudWatch logs S3 buckets used for temporary storage EventBridge schedules SNS topics Temporary IAM roles or SCPs This helps avoid unnecessary charges and maintains account hygiene.\nConclusion DNS failures can be catastrophic, but they are also highly preventable.\nBy integrating:\nAutomated backups, Real-time monitoring, Least privilege access controls, and Organization-level enforcement, you can build a resilient DNS architecture that prevents outages, improves operational stability, and safeguards your applications against unintended disruptions.\n"

	"content": "AWS First Cloud AI Journey – Project Plan Online Shopping Website: Furious Five Fashion (FFF) AWS \u0026amp; AI-Powered E-commerce Website Solution 1. Background and Motivation 1.1 Executive Summary The client is a small-sized business specializing in fashion products for young customers. They aim to build an online clothing e-commerce website using AWS and AI, with the ability to scale flexibly, support long-term growth, and optimize operational costs.\nThe goal of this project is to shift from traditional manual management on physical servers to a flexible, intelligent, and cost-efficient cloud-based model. AWS enables the system to scale at any time, maintain fast access speed, and allow the business to focus on product development instead of infrastructure.\nThe system is designed to support end-to-end e-commerce operations: hosting and distributing web content, managing product and order databases, supporting payments, and monitoring system performance. Everything aims toward stability, security, and long-term scalability.\nThe Furious Five implementation team will accompany the client throughout the process—advising, designing the architecture, and configuring key AWS services such as Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, CloudFront, and Route 53. Beyond building the system, they also help optimize costs, ensure security, and train the internal team to manage the infrastructure effectively.\nThis project is not just a technical plan—it marks an important step in the company’s digital transformation journey.\n1.2 Project Success Criteria To ensure the success of the Furious Five Fashion project, the following clear and measurable criteria must be met, representing both business goals and technical effectiveness:\nSystem Performance The website must maintain response times under 2 seconds for all user actions, even during peak hours.\nAvailability The system must achieve 99.9% uptime, monitored and automatically reported through services like CloudWatch.\nScalability AWS infrastructure must scale automatically when traffic increases by at least 2× without causing service disruption.\nCost Optimization Monthly operating costs must remain under 30% of the projected budget, supported by AWS cost-monitoring tools such as Cost Explorer and Trusted Advisor.\nSecurity No data leaks or unauthorized access. All customer data must be protected by AWS security standards (IAM policies, encryption, HTTPS, etc.).\nDeployment \u0026amp; Operations Infrastructure must be fully deployed within 4 weeks, with complete documentation so the internal team can manage the environment effectively.\nTraining \u0026amp; Knowledge Transfer The internal technical team must be trained to confidently maintain, monitor, and secure the system without depending entirely on external support.\n1.3 Assumptions To ensure alignment and smooth execution of the FFF project, the following assumptions have been made:\nThe team already has access to AWS accounts with required permissions and has basic knowledge of essential AWS services such as Lambda, S3, IAM, and Route 53. Stable Internet connectivity is assumed since all infrastructure runs in the cloud. The team is also aware of basic security and compliance requirements before deployment.\nThe project depends on multiple external factors: stable service availability in the selected AWS region, smooth domain routing via Route 53, and effective collaboration between development teams to ensure the web application operates properly in the cloud environment.\nThe project is part of an internship, so the budget is limited—favoring free-tier usage and low-cost service configurations. Due to limited experience and tight timelines, the chosen architecture remains simple and practical.\nPotential risks include IAM misconfigurations, accidental overspending due to unused resources, AWS regional outages, service incompatibilities, or limited expertise in troubleshooting cloud systems.\nDespite these risks, the project is built on clear expectations: this is a pilot environment, with layered monitoring, backup, and cost-management strategies in place. Every challenge is considered an opportunity to learn and grow in cloud engineering.\n2. SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE 2.1 Technical Architecture Diagram The following architecture is designed for FFF, deployed in AWS Region Singapore (ap-southeast-1). It emphasizes flexibility, security, automation, scalability, and simplicity—appropriate for an internship-level project while following AWS best practices.\nThe system follows a multi-layer design consisting of six key components:\nFrontend \u0026amp; Security Layer Users access the website through Route 53. Incoming traffic is protected with AWS WAF and optimized via CloudFront CDN. Source code is managed and deployed through GitLab CI/CD using CloudFormation templates.\nAPI \u0026amp; Compute Layer API Gateway routes all requests to AWS Lambda, which handles application logic. Cognito manages authentication and access control.\nStorage Layer Two S3 buckets store static content (StaticData) and user uploads.\nData Layer DynamoDB stores product metadata and unstructured data. IAM ensures secure interactions between components.\nAI Layer Amazon Rekognition and Amazon Bedrock power image processing and generative AI features.\nObservability \u0026amp; Security Layer CloudWatch, SNS, and SES provide monitoring, alerting, and system notifications.\n2.2 Technical Implementation Plan Infrastructure will be managed and deployed using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS CloudFormation to ensure repeatability, stability, and ease of maintenance.\nKey AWS components—S3, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Cognito, and CloudWatch—will be defined entirely through CloudFormation templates stored in GitLab for version control and rollback capability.\nSensitive configurations such as IAM permissions or WAF rules require approval before deployment and follow the internal governance process with review and validation.\nAll critical system paths—from authentication to data processing—are covered by automated and manual test cases to ensure stability, security, and scalability.\nThis technical plan enables the FFF team to deploy and manage a professional cloud environment, learning real DevOps and AWS best practices.\n2.3 Project Plan The project follows Agile Scrum over 3 months, divided into 4 sprints.\nSprint Structure\nSprint Planning\nSetup AWS foundational services (S3, Route 53, IAM)\nConfigure security (WAF, CloudFront)\nIntegrate backend (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB)\nTesting, optimization, and demo preparation\nDaily Stand-up 30-minute updates to address blockers and track status.\nSprint Review Review deliverables, demo on real AWS environment, fix issues.\nRetrospective Improve DevOps workflows and automation pipeline.\nTeam Roles\nProduct Owner: Business alignment, backlog prioritization\nScrum Master: Coordination, Agile process enforcement\nDevOps/Technical Team: Backend, infrastructure, CI/CD\nMentor / AWS Partner: Architecture validation, AI testing, cost \u0026amp; security review\nCommunication Rhythm\nDaily Stand-ups (23:00)\nWeekly Sync\nEnd-of-Sprint Demo\nKnowledge Transfer After the final sprint, the technical team will deliver hands-on training on operations, monitoring (Budgets, CloudWatch), scaling, and recovery procedures.\n2.4 Security Considerations Access Management MFA for admin users; IAM roles with least privilege; auditing through CloudTrail.\nInfrastructure Security\nEven without a dedicated VPC, services are restricted using resource policies; all public endpoints use HTTPS.\nData Protection\nS3 and DynamoDB encryption; TLS data transfer; manual periodic backups.\nDetection \u0026amp; Monitoring\nCloudTrail, Config, and CloudWatch for visibility; GuardDuty for threat detection.\nIncident Response\nClear incident workflows with log collection, analysis, and periodic simulations.\n3.

Interface endpoints work with resources running in VPC, and also resources running in on-premises environments. Connectivty from your on-premises environment to the cloud can be provided by AWS Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Interface endpoints allow you to connect to services powered by AWS PrivateLink. These services include some AWS services, services hosted by other AWS customers and partners in their own VPCs (referred to as PrivateLink Endpoint Services), and supported AWS Marketplace Partner services.

	"content": "AWS PrivateLink endpoints have a fixed IP address in each Availability Zone where they are deployed, for the life of the endpoint (until it is deleted). These IP addresses are attached to Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs). AWS recommends using DNS to resolve the IP addresses for endpoints so that downstream applications use the latest IP addresses when ENIs are added to new AZs, or deleted over time.\nIn this section, you will create a forwarding rule to send DNS resolution requests from a simulated on-premises environment to a Route 53 Private Hosted Zone. This section leverages the infrastructure deployed by CloudFormation in the Prepare the environment section.\nCreate DNS Alias Records for the Interface endpoint Navigate to the Route 53 management console (Hosted Zones section).

Outside of a workshop environment, you might use this feature to forward DNS queries from your VPC to DNS servers running on-premises. In this section, you will simulate an on-premises conditional forwarder by creating a forwarding rule that forwards DNS queries for Amazon S3 to a Private Hosted Zone running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; in-order to resolve the PrivateLink interface endpoint regional DNS name.\nFrom the Route 53 management console, click Inbound endpoints on the left side bar In the Inbound endpoints console, click the ID of the inbound endpoint Copy the two IP addresses listed to your text editor From the Route 53 menu, choose Resolver \u0026gt; Rules, and click Create rule: In the Create rule console: Name: myS3Rule Rule type: Forward Domain name: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com VPC: VPC On-prem Outbound endpoint: VPCOnpremOutboundEndpoint Target IP Addresses: Enter both IP addresses from your text editor (inbound endpoint addresses) and then click Submit You have successfully created resolver forwarding rule.\nTest the on-premises DNS Simulation Connect to Test-Interface-Endpoint EC2 instance with Session manager Test DNS resolution. The dig command will return the IP addresses assigned to the VPC Interface endpoint running in VPC Cloud (your IP\u0026rsquo;s will be different): dig +short s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com The IP addresses returned are the VPC endpoint IP addresses, NOT the Resolver IP addresses you pasted from your text editor. The IP addresses of the Resolver endpoint and the VPC endpoint look similar because they are all from the VPC Cloud CIDR block.\nNavigate to the VPC menu (Endpoints section), select the S3 Interface endpoint. Click the Subnets tab and verify that the IP addresses returned by Dig match the VPC endpoint: Return to your shell and use the AWS CLI to test listing your S3 buckets: aws s3 ls --endpoint-url https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com Terminate your Session Manager session: In this section you created an Interface endpoint for Amazon S3. This endpoint can be reached from on-premises through Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoints simulated forwarding DNS requests from on-premises to a Private Hosted Zone running the cloud. Route 53 inbound Endpoints recieved the resolution request and returned a response containing the IP addresses of the VPC interface endpoint.

A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint. If you do not attach a policy when you create an endpoint, AWS attaches a default policy for you that allows full access to the service through the endpoint.\nYou can create a policy that restricts access to specific S3 buckets only. This is useful if you only want certain S3 Buckets to be accessible through the endpoint.\nIn this section you will create a VPC endpoint policy that restricts access to the S3 bucket specified in the VPC endpoint policy.\nConnect to an EC2 instance and verify connectivity to S3 Start a new AWS Session Manager session on the instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. From the session, verify that you can list the contents of the bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC: aws s3 ls s3://\\\u0026lt;your-bucket-name\\\u0026gt; The bucket contents include the two 1 GB files uploaded in earlier.\nCreate a new S3 bucket; follow the naming pattern you used in Part 1, but add a \u0026lsquo;-2\u0026rsquo; to the name.

Company Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe company culture is very positive: everyone is respectful, works seriously, yet maintains a pleasant atmosphere. When urgent tasks arise, the entire team works together regardless of their roles or seniority. This made me feel like a real member of the team, even as an intern.\n6. Internship Policies / Benefits\nThe company provides an internship allowance and offers flexible working hours when needed. Being able to join internal training sessions is also a major benefit that helps me build additional knowledge.\nAdditional Questions — Answers 1. What did I find most satisfying during the internship?\nWhat I appreciated most was the opportunity to gain real-world Cloud knowledge and the dedicated guidance from my mentor. I learned how to think systematically, ask the right questions, and approach issues independently—skills that are essential for my future career. The supportive environment also motivated me to keep improving each day.\n2. What should the company improve for future interns?\nFrom my perspective, the program is already well structured. However, FCJ could consider adding:\nCareer orientation workshops led by experienced professionals More group-based exercises or simulated real projects A fixed weekly mentoring schedule to help interns track progress more effectively These improvements could further enhance the overall learning experience.\n3. Would I recommend this internship to a friend? Why or why not?\nAbsolutely yes.\nFCJ offers a positive environment, dedicated mentors, clear learning pathways, and exposure to modern technologies. It is an excellent place for anyone aspiring to pursue Cloud or DevOps.\nSuggestions \u0026amp; Expectations — Answers 1. Suggestions for improving the internship experience\nI would like to propose a few ideas:\nBuilding a centralized learning hub for easy access to all study materials Adding topic-focused mini-projects to immediately apply new knowledge Incorporating regular two-way feedback sessions between mentors and interns These additions can make the learning experience more practical and engaging.\n2. Expectations for continuing with the program\nIf given the opportunity, I would be happy to continue participating in future phases of FCJ. I hope to be involved in real projects and develop deeper expertise in areas such as Cloud Architecture, Monitoring, Security, or Automation.\n3. Additional comments\nMy time at FCJ not only improved my technical skills but also helped me clarify my long-term career direction.
